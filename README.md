## Research

### Kalwun

- Kalwun has an 'Upcoming Events' section in their homepage. - Ask if we require an events calendar.
- Kalwun has a minimal small tile based links section - rather then individual sections to highlight services and info, they just link to their pages.
- Kalwun has a revolving gallery hero section with 3 CTA's.
- Kalwun site structure is alike what i had aimed to achieve, several sections with subsection tabs leading to different pages in the site.

### Atsichs

- on first glance, Atsich's looks like how i plan to have the site laid out
 - Category / Subcategory (optional) / Slug
- main site pages are in an enhanced blog like form which makes it look hard coded
 - tables, and downloadable resources as extra, CTA, multiple columns, lots of customisation. Thats not to say however that there ar no issues - There are broken components all over the place if you look hard enough. (EDIT - On code review, it is hard coded - Alot of mistakes and code left in.)
- Mobile menu is difficult to navigate, theres no distinction between parent and child navigation made on expanding tabs.
- Site Structure is as follows:
Home
 - Services & support
  - Covid-19 support
  - NDIS
  - Health & wellbeing
   - Medical Clinics
   - Dental Clinics
   - Allied Health
   - Community Groups
